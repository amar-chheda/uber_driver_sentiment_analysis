3,5.0,"Santa Ana, CA",2019-03-16,,,,,Uber is a great job where you can communicate with your riders and have a fun conversation to make the ride more enjoyable.

Youre treated like a number, and thats a double digit number.",,,Uber touts 24 hour customer service but that's a joke. No transparency. No cohesiveness. It's almost like they're trained not to tell you what you need to know.
6,1.0,"Miami, FL",2019-03-09,Not many,Working for uber is a con,1,,They Lie take more of your pay than they tell you don't take care of the driver Basically not worth it even if the passenger lies they believe them over the driver it not a good app because you do not work for UBER directly any way you just use there App and make them money
7,2.0,"Houston, TX",2019-03-09,Your own time,Almost everything once you are on,1,,"Uber usually gets you rides when you turn on their app.  However the pay is very low here in Houston.  App navigation is poor and not accurate.  Forget about long pick up fee, even though Uber says it pays; I received .07 cents for a 22 minutes pick up.  Support is the worst; contract to some foreign country with lack of understanding the US.  Bottom line is Uber is taking advantage of drivers who are in need of a job.  Most drivers who has a disadvantage in English will not understand how they maybe ripped off by Uber.  And even when they knew about it, try to get support to fix it is another story."
8,2.0,"Toledo, OH",2019-03-08,make your own hours,poor compensation for use of your own vehicle,3,1,"poor work environment..no work advancement. poor compensation for car insurance, insurance, mileage and fuel costs. best pay equals the poorest work hours"

Look I made a total of $298.00 on a 6 hour work night not once but on a couple occasions, where can you make that kind of money and be your own Boss doing it for as least amount of capital doing it? NOWHERE unless you're already a millionaire."
12,1.0,Brighton uk,2019-03-07,Work when you like,Congestion never taken into account and very high fees.,1,,Was told when I started that after 500jobs that I would only pay 15% charges but that was not the case and just been told it will always be 25%  so not happy at all about that. Lots of dead mileage and congestion is never taken into account. Some jobs given to me 10 to 15miles away I did that once thinking it would be a long run but realised it was a lousy local job for 3-67.
13,2.0,"Houston, TX",2019-03-05,Do it when you want to,Not enough pay for your car's expenses.,1,,"Too many drivers out there, not enough business during weeks at a time.  Pay did not meet expenses for the automobile(gas, tolls, maintenance, insurance and all the other stuff you do to have a car) I drove for Uber and put 10,000 miles on in 6 weeks.  You will wear a car out quickly, so figure that into your plan.  It's as if Uber seeks people who have cars they can depreciate so fast before they can pay for it."
14,5.0,"Los Angeles, CA",2019-03-04,Not enough money,Long hours,,1,Pick up and drop of passengers or food. Became very familiar with street in Los Angeles and San Diego. What I’ve learned is they’re a busy day and not so busy days i prefer consistency. You are your own boss. The workplace is great got to interact with different people from different backgrounds.
15,3.0,"Maui, HI",2019-03-04,"Making ur own schedule, make a few extra dollars",Doesn’t pay enough,,,Making your own schedule is cool. But it sucks that the fairs are super low. U can’t make a living driving Uber. Not enough fairs to begin with and fairs are super cheap.
16,1.0,"Albuquerque, NM",2019-03-03,Meet people make connections,Everything else,3,,"Sure you can work ""whenever you like"" but driving on a Wednesday at 2am vs Friday at 8pm is a no brainer.  You're nowhere near your own boss. 2 1/2 years later and I can definitively tell you that as a fact. I've had to decide on whether to pay bills or fix my car(s) too many times to count. I've lost 3 vehicles so far. The only reason I continue are my children and a lack of reliable safe childcare in my area. I've had the same issue with my account for over 5 months now and they have yet to even address it. You're not able to resource your work in case you need to show proof of income or expenses. You never speak to the same driver support agent twice. There's no real assistance when you need it. Passengers are still allowed to ride with very low ratings. They're allowing too many substandard drivers to drive which creates negative for the next driver. They minimize the add a tip section, so many times people miss it completely. They control how much of a tip drivers can actually receive on a ride. The list is endless, to be honest"

19,1.0,"Nashville, TN",2019-02-28,Set your own schedule,Low pay and long hours.,5,1,"When I first started working with the company the pay was good, though there was no technical support. The latter part changed eventually, but mostly to automated systems. What you can expect as a current driver or future driver is constantly decreasing wages and eventually a loss of job once driver-less cars come online. From when I started to now, my income dropped by more than half in less than a year. Stay away unless your desperate, there are no benefits or compensation."

People that dont own a car or cant drive complain about your car and driving because theyr life sucks and give bad reaviews no matter how hard u try (the uber system its set up u dont have any rights as a driver). A little pay exmaple if ur rider pays 5$ Uber will collect 2.25 and ur left with 2.75$ and u dont even get a “thank you” but they will slam your doors as hard as they can because 90% of the time ur riding lossers around that lost theyr licence or never owned a car.

And lots of $3.12 Cent Rides. Customers pay good money for these rides. But Uber will keep most of the money, and pay you for GAS. Then we have medium rides where you made decent money.But now Uber Steal that money from Drivers, so those suck too.Then we have Long Rides. This is great for UBER, this is wherethey do not pay anything for Gas, and again keep most of the money.Uber are sleezy criminals who lie, cheat, and steal from drivers.Even the 5 Star Rating system broke 3 weeks ago.

58,4.0,"Denver, CO",2019-01-24,,,2,2,"As with any job when you learn how to be better than the others you can make more money. If you are a people's person, have a fun attitude, a clean car, know the city and you are a safe driver you can earn more tips. The best way to maximize earnings is to start very early on weekdays and drive between (5AM-10AM) in the suburbs where people go to work or to the airport. Then drive in the evenings (5PM-10PM) downtown or any area where there are office buildings. On the weekends you need to drive very late until 2AM-3AM. If you drive these hours you are likely to unlock all the extra money Uber offers in bonuses, quests, consecutive trips and make around $1300 a week. You also need to drive a hybrid if you are full time, that saves you hundreds of $ each month."

69,1.0,"San Francisco, CA",2019-01-17,scheduele,tons,7,,"Uber is a lot of driving for very very little money. It is not hard manual labor such as digging ditches in the sun, which I would prefer, but if you are interested in making anything over $400 a week you better plan on spending a minimum of 50 to 60 hours a week in your car. The wear and tear on a car is Dreadful. Traffic, gasoline, rude Riders increase stress level. I would not recommend for anybody except for those who need a little extra spending money on the side"

I had great riders for the most point. If any rider gets sick in your car, Uber reimburse you for any clean up . That in a meager plus in my book.

The flexibility of my own schedule has been great.  I will likely continue driving on a part-time basis for extra income, but have found that driving full-time does not meet our financial needs.  Our market is a city of approximately 50,000 and there seems to be a fair number of drivers competing for business.  My average weekly gross has been about $550 but fuel costs average about $110/week (mini-van).  Also, vehicle maintenance costs have significantly impacted my income.

After a few months I put around  40k miles on my vehicle. And was spending about 40$ a day in fuel 6 days a week. If you take the gas cost of 240$ a week minus the 600 that leaves 340$ subtract taxes 90$ now you get 250$ once you take in account for insurance,   car payments,  and wear and tear on the vehicle you are not making anything.  In addition it is very stressful driving 20 minutes on the highway to only take a passenger 3 miles and get 3.67$ for the ride. However I have now corrected this because I no longer accept rides more than 7 minutes away from where I am. In the end  uber would be a good option if you wanted to make a couple dollars once in a while , not very good option for full time gig. The only way to correct the problem with the pay is for them to set their cut they get lower so more profits are given to the driver and not Uber.

On top of that you have to consider an average of 250 miles a day, the depreciation on your car goes up pretty rapidly.You have to save for repairs on that car, and save for the days the car is in the shop because Uber does not allow you to work on a rental or a lawner."

Independence.,Support is horrible and the stress is not worth the job.,4,,"The concept of driving for Uber is great. It’s easy money when there is volume and the job is not stressful. The stress begins when you have a problem and need support. Good luck! For no reason at all (I think adding my new inspection report triggered it),  Uber started another background check and it has been over 4 weeks (I had already been driving for 6 months with a 4.98 rating after 375 rides) and Uber support (in some faraway country)  just keeps repeating “it can take 5-7 business days.” I haven’t been able to drive for over a month and it has nothing to do with me or a background check. It has to do with lack of communication,  and with technology that is not streamlined across the board.  The background check is just one example. I could go on and on. It is seriously the most stressful and most horrible support I have ever experienced. If you can avoid getting trapped in a cycle of  h e l l  with Uber support (which I highly doubt since it will be inevitable), the job itself won’t make you rich but it’s nice to make your own hours and be your own boss."

I think Uber is better as they are a cheaper option than Taxi but Uber should atleast pay drivers .70 per mile and/or get paid MUCH more for our time as time is something we will never get back. I think Uber pays us .1575 per min. The other con is the app has glitches such as GPS freezing or is not always accurate and will take you to a vendor delivery entrance versus the Uber pick up and drop off so it's recommended you know your way around your city well. Also, when the driver cancels because the rider is not there or too many people, or the rider is rude, etc. Uber should automatically provide driver a Cancellation fee rather than us having to call every other day. Uber also claims to take safety of drivers very seriously but I had an intoxicated guy with his wife attempt to attack me because he thought I was someone named Rob...all Uber did was ""ensure I never receive that ride again"", which I wouldn't anyway in such a transient town...but that was frustrating because I was placed in a dangerous situation and all they can do was block me from the rider and read a script (carry pepper spray).The Pros to working here:You're self employed so you control your own hours and can work as little as much as you want. The GPS does work well in a sense of giving you the best and quickest route. The promotions and surges are great and it would be nice to get more of that. You get to meet"

Hardest part of the job would be when intoxicated people ride, sometimes they can be belligerent or the possibility of them making a mess of your vehicle. Aside from those two things, what was difficult was when people would be mean and give you a false report. Im not sure what you could do about being falsely reported because there really wasn't a protection mechanism for drivers.

Uber charged around $13-$14 from the customers for the trip, but i got paid only $6.77. When i contacted the technical team they were saying that the price calculation was correct and they cannot adjust the fare. So driver is not even getting paid half of the customer payment.

This is a nickle above the standard mileage rate. They did increase the per minute rate from .15 cents per mile to .21 cents and claims that driver pay ""should"" be the same.

These include drug runners, minors, ladies of the night, and people with bad intentions.  Driving for Uber is essentially taking out a pay day loan on value of your car and quickly turning it into a worthless pile of garbage. Uber decided a long time ago to stem some of their losses (they have never made a profit) by cutting driver pay and endlessly recruiting new drivers.

Honestly if you have any past customer service skill personally I come from food service, serving, bar tending, ect and if you can read a room and know who wants to talk and who just wants to ride in silence for example you'll excel and make a ton of money. Keep your car clean, open doors when possible (note not in the city ANYWHERE-DANGEROUS) and you can make as much money as you want. Let your GPS do all the driving and if a customer tells you to go a different way, amuse them and go the way they tell you, its their dime and if they are wrong you make more money anyways. CHEERS"

The money I made in the beginning was great in NYC as they had 30,000 drivers. Fastforward today and there are close to 100,000 drivers.

First my area around my house was dead, so that required me to drive 20min in any direction to find a customer to start the day. Hopefully it was a fair distance because they would pay better. If you did a lot of small drives that works but is harder on your car. And that's the 2nd major problem, if you do it full time, it will destroy your car, so make sure it has 4 doors and is great on gas. Thirdly if you don't mind driving in NY you could do that but needed a special license, which I never had. That means you could only drop off and not pickup customers. So if you live in a populated area and want to do a few quick drives it's fine. Making a career is tough."

If your giving the riders promotions then why penalize the driver? And if the rider is committing some type of fraud you should penalize the rider and not your driver. I really don’t feel as if that is fair why isn’t the rider being penalized after I have driven out all of my gas to take their riders home or to their various destinations. now I don’t have the gas that I need to take my family where I need to take them nor do I have the gas to make more trips as they suggested to be the solution to my problem. I wouldn’t recommend driving for this company they don’t care about their employees. And when it’s time to cash out they come up with excuses as to why you can’t.

However I wouldn't advise as a full time arrangement. The compensation for the amount of wear and tear on your vehicle is not worth it in the long run. If you use the lease or rent a vehicle program you end up spending a lot of working time just to cover your cost of the vehicle.

If you don't mind an average of $10 an hour, I highly recommend it. I had a blast driving in the Los Angeles area for a year and a half. It was so neat to be my own boss. I set my own hours without worrying that I would be late, I dressed how I wanted but appropriately for a customer service job, I took breaks when I needed to, I could keep Dr's appointments without being reprimanded and I got to meet all kinds of people from different places and walks of life. The few cons are that it does allot of damage to your car, zero benefits, driver support was non-existent and they were quick to deactivate a driver for the most petty complaints from a passenger. If I didn't move, I would definitely still be driving."

When you calculate gas, maintenance, and car washes. You don’t make anything. Houston is usually busy Thursday to Saturday all other days you have to drive for about 8 hrs to make $100. The queue lone at the air ports are ridiculously long. One is usually 150+ and the other is usually 60+ cars. Also Uber does NOT deduct taxes. At the end of last year I had a nice surprise.

So there is no justification for those changes, Uber is practicing bait and switch scheme on his own workers/contractors drivers.Conclusion: Uber claims are LIES!!!So the driver is being ripped off - after taxes, gas cost, insurance cost, maintnance cost, wear and tear of the vehicle, increase in average miles on the vehicle; drivers get phony pocket money and waist their time."

The pay is very low, you’ll be driving all over the city getting fares and you’ll be lucky to get more than $4 per trip even if you take them more than 10 miles. There’s been times where I would drive way out of the way to accept a ride only to find out their destination is within walking distance of their house and get $3 in payment. (Too lazy to walk 3 blocks)The clientele are pretty bad too, especially in California. Most of the people you’ll pick up are stuck up, narcissistic, liberal hipsters that will often insult you and make fun of you to your face. They also have zero respect for your property and will often slam your doors and create messes in your car. (It’s not their property so they don’t care) If you drive past 8pm you’re going to get many drunks and don’t even get me started on the horror story expirences I had with them. Uber Eats/Deliveries are a scam, you’ll drive 10 mins to pick up food and another 10 mins to deliver it to the house and you’ll be lucky to get $4. You will spend more in gas than what you will get paid.It’s almost a given you will not get a tip. 95% of riders do not tip.I would honestly say stay away from Uber until they raise their wages for drivers.

I’ve been doing lyft in the meantime so I don’t really care to not have access to doing Uber, which I do prefer because of the ability to do Uber eats during rush hours and night time. Anywho, if you plan on doing this full time be prepared for random background checks which can put you out of work for weeks.

If you want to make $100 or more, on a normal day, you'll be driving for over 12 hours. If you're wanting to go for something modest, like $50 extra (in the Altamonte-Sanford-Longwood area), you'll be driving for 6-8 hours.When driving, you are not compensated for the time it takes to get from where you are, to the restaurant. There are times where Uber will try and give you a 25 minute or more away pickup destination, which I advise always turning down.McDonald's trips are also advised to never take. When you arrive, you can EXPECT to be waiting on your order. This is because all stores are told, by McD Corporate, to not start working on delivery orders until the driver arrives. There are times where you're dropped to the bottom of the importance list, and will wait 15-25-35 minutes for a McChicken and Coke (personal experience). YOU ARE NOT PAID FOR THIS WAITING TIME.When working, you are not compensated for gas. If you take a toll road (the Uber Eats app will tell you to take them), you are not compensated for the toll. If you drive in Downtown Orlando and have to pay for parking, you are not compensated. You are not compensated for fluids or vehicular maintenance of any sort. The more you drive for Uber Eats, the more likely you are of being fired. The company measures how many times you're late to pick food up and drop it off as a hard number, not a percentage. So if you drive 10 times and are late 5 times, or if you drive 100 times and are late 5 times, it doesn't matter- you're getting close to being removed"

The hardest part of the job is Rude Riders who try to operate your radio and A/C as if it's their car. The best part is the Nice Riders who are polite and sober. What Culture? LOL! I learned to get around town. Management?  Really? I've never met any management but I wish they'd stop taking so much of the money that we earn for them.

It's super flexible in that you can work whenever you want, for as long as you want. Being a college student Uber was perfect as I could work whenever I didn't have classes, a lot of homework, or a big exam to study for. I will say though that Uber is the type of job that you get out of it what you put in. If you put in the hours you will make great money. You also have to understand that depending on where you live the market can be stable, fluctuate, or be poor. For example in Cleveland (OH) there is a high demand so the majority of the time there are surge prices so Uber drivers make great money. In Columbus (OH) it fluctuates depending on the day, time of day, location and if there's a big event in town like a festival or concert. And finally in a small town the demand would be low because not that many people use or know about Uber so your earning opportunities are lower. Overall it is a really nice convenient job."

You simply won't make enough money.  I do it for spending money.  Although half of what I make goes to gas, the rest helps me with groceries in between paychecks from my full-time job.  The pay isn't all that great, I average between $4-$7 a trip and although Uber states they support tipping they bury it so deep inside the app that customers don't use it. Don't expect tips.  I've made over 60 deliveries this past week and not one penny in tips.  In addition, the delivery app has no way to contact a customer until you mark the delivery as being picked up.  So what happens if there's a problem at the restaurant and you need to notify the customer?  You have to mark the order as being picked up even though you haven't actually done that - just so you can call the customer.  Uber's customer service suggests you contact them and they will reach out to the customer but when there's a 5-10 minute wait to reach a live person that's not a viable option.  Finally, there's no way to set a preferred area of delivery.  You will deliver in the area you are in so if you are picking up locally then delivering 15 minutes away your next delivery will be in the area 15 minutes away.  You can avoid that by going offline after you drop the food off, go back to the area you want to be in, then go online again.  All of this being said, you work when you feel like it and it's some extra money that you can collect daily (up to five times a day). If you don't mind driving and meeting people then it's not a bad way to"

You really do have to put some effort and thought into where and when ( what time of day) you drive or else you will not see positive results. I recommend for anyone who needs more income or has a car that is paid for. If you have a brand new car i would not recommend running it into the ground so early on you want to enjoy your car as log as you can. Gas and maintenance cost all come out of your pocket. Some people definitely make a living off of this however MOST DO NOT. Its no harm to try it out if you are curious apply and see what happens if you dont like it stop at any time.

They change the way they did the surge prices at the airport. customers believe that we get 80% of the price that they pay. The riders hardly Tip. Uber takes entirely too much money out of the cut. They do not encourage the customers to Tip. When ever we find out a way to make the good money with Uber they make changes to the app so we cannot make the money that we want.  Even though they're trying to get better they're dropping the ball. We used to have six destination trips a day they took that away. Which I was making really good money on the six destination trips. They do not honor Surge prices all the time. Customers don't know we have to maintain a 4.6 rating to continue to pick up for Uber. They do a poor job explaining to the customer of how much money we actually make for a trip. in a week only eight to $35 in tips will be given from the riders , which means we have to stay on the road for a long time to make good money. The gas is going up but the rates or not. I can make more money delivering pizzas  then working  for Uber.

Plus you can get very short rides and make even less than $5 a trip. I also, as a driver, very much liked the surge feature which multiples your earnings when demand gets very high, though I don't think I ever had a surge ride myself. There are also boosts where in certain areas and times you will get an automatic multiplier, surge or not.Lastly is the rating system. I still have an account, though my rating is not very good. This is the reason you can get terminated, the riders can rate you and Uber doesn't seem to care about rider ratings, they'll keep riders even if their rating is the worst possible (unless they commit a crime or something, of course) but drivers get terminated frequently. They offer a class to help you if your rating is very low, mine was low, just the feedback system needs to be better, I'd like it if I was rated on specific things, and the rider could post a comment saying what was wrong, like ebays feedback, unfortunately this is not how it is."

There are plenty of risks of wasting a ton of gas, because you don't get paid to drive to pick up the passenger, and the passenger may cancel at the last minute.....which I've had happen a few times. It's frustrating to drive 20-30 minutes to the middle of nowhere and have the passenger cancel. You get paid a small cancellation fee, but that doesn't help, considering the wear and tear. You don't get to see where the passenger is during the 15 seconds you have to accept the ping. Because of this reason, I have travelled to the bigger cities where passengers are closer together.I did one UberEats order, which was horrible.

You must use the (boost) system put in place to the fullest and always watch your pay, length of delivery, where to, time waiting on food prep and drop offs. Other complications arise where Uber can come out ahead on your dime so be wary and stand up for yourself. You are also in a ratings system. You are always in the the wrong when dealing with clients, even when they cause issues. Remember you use your car, 95% of people may need to change car insurance to a ride sharing one. You will file taxes for yourself. Overall Uber is another greedy company willing to use it's drivers till there's nothing left. For most folks it's impossible to come out ahead. Many other factors come into play I haven't mentioned. So be careful if you Uber drive and I hoped this helped."

My mistake for wanting to go full time and trusting them but to their credit it was the flexible schedule that lured me in. A lot of late night intoxicated people I drove home safely but sadly if one or two complain about your driving for example wrong turn and then decide to say something bad to UBEr about you it is bye bye driving job as they pull your app and you don't know if you will get it back. Also low ratings which is not low 4.6 out of five it is bye bye driving app. So no wonder why they always need drivers at UBER as it is because of how poor they treat the drivers and how much it cost you to drive for them with miles, gas, higher taxes, vehicle depreciation.

I find difficulties in picking people up at the specific areas they are calling from and even though the passengers are in my vehicle, sometimes driving around buildings/hotels just to start a trip. The same holds true when dropping someone off. I cannot end the trip until my phone says I can end the trip and wasted valuable time in doing so. Poor G.P.S. system being used in my mind. Sometimes leading me in unnecessary directions as well and avoiding a more direct route such as the Manchester/Boston airport. Leading me down a congested road with an accident on it instead of avoiding it completely and averting it with a more direct and uncongested route.

I mentioned in the below post, passenger feels they are paying the driver the full fair when in fact Uber gets a pretty good share of that!! Well guess what.... YOU HAVE TO PAY THE INCOME TAXES ON UBERS FEES!!!I worked part time for Uber for 2 months. Direct deposited into my account during that time was a total of $463.15 ($12.44 was reimbursed tolls I already paid) so I made $450.71.Guess what.... Uber 1099'S me for $725.91!!!!! Why? Because I have to pay the tax on Ubers booking and service fees!!!! I didn't see a penny of this extra $275.20 that I have to pay tax on, the passenger paid it, but Uber received it AND I HAVE TO PAY THE TAX ON IT!!!! Yes you can ""write it off"" under your expenses, but you pay more than you will benefit from write off. Total BS!!!Plus I put about 80 hours in and over 900 miles on my car...

I had gone through 5 different background checks through out entire period of being a driver for Uber and maintained the same background as I signed up with. Not even a single traffic citation for over 7 years, yet Uber rewarded me by deactivating me because of a misdemeanor over 9 years ago that they were aware of since signing up. I literally drove passengers who told me that I was the most courteous and safe driver they ever experienced. So I highly recommend that you don't drive for this company especially if you have even a minor conviction in your background. Don't believe the screening requirements listed on their page because its 100% FALSE. And theirs no way to appeal once deactivated. I went to greenhub and even they told me that I shouldn't have been deactivated so they reset the background check and had me esign to run a new check. Went online the next day to see the status and they rejected my account without even allowing the background check to re-run."

You get paid more to ferry a rider rather than food. If your wait time is excessive you can cancel, but it shows negatively on your ratings.

I can work whenever I want, I can put 8 hours in on Uber a day and take as many breaks as I want, but still making it a full-time job.  Do I recommend doing this full-time? No, if you are using your own personal car (which I am), you will put excessive miles on your car, and will be looking at 1-2 oil changes a month, along with rotating tires, wheel balancing, etc.. I got my car 6 months ago, and I have put over 20,000 miles on it so far.  You don't get paid to pick people up unless it's over a certain timeframe, and you never know where you will be taking someone.  You may drive 20 minutes away and start the trip, and they only want to go a mile up the road giving you the minimum that Uber will pay their drivers which is $3.67.  It goes both ways though, you may drive 4 minutes away and the passenger wants to go 20+ minutes away  For example, I drove 96.23 miles away which took a total of 4 hours to get there and get back home and I made $98.91.  It does alert you if you will be driving 45 minutes away or longer.  It can be stressful at times, when the Uber Driver App is not working properly and I have to call in to support to speak with them about any issue I may be having.  Overall, Uber will make your social skills great, meeting all types of people, along with giving you good pay days, and will keep you motivated to keep your car in perfect condition."

It is extremely stressful because you are constantly trying to maintain safety in an unsafe traffic environment.  One of the things I learned is that many passengers only care about swiftness of trip and nothing about safety and Uber doesn't pay drivers by the minutes like cab drivers.  with Uber you are only paid by the number of trip miles.

As others have said, you make your own schedule. I do 3-5 hrs a day after I drop my daughter at school. Compensation stinks, and due to Ubers fees, drivers feel that the driver is getting that money, and we are not, so they don't feel a need to tip. One example :  27 mile trip, took 40 minutes. Passenger pays $35.30.... Driver receives 25.42, Uber 9.88. My ""earnings"" include $2.38 in tolls, which I have already prepaid, so that should not be included in earnings. So earnings were actually $23.04. Now this is a 27 mile trip, that works out to $0.85 per mile. Oh wait, I have to drive back 20 miles to get home. That makes this trip 47 miles , that totals $0.49 per mile, and over an hour of my time.. Not to mention gas and wear and tear..... Not really worth it. In one week, 24 rides, only four tipped for a total of $12.00. I do have 100% 5 star rating.

The hardest part of the job is when the area you're working in is saturated and there simply aren't enough riders to keep you moving in that case.

Being one of those people as well as from NY (driving in California) the environment of uber is what you make it within your car and completely limitless outside of your car in terms of the places you will be and end up. Uber has been working extremely hard the last 6 months to cater to the needs of drivers which has increased my outlook on management greatly. Things that I've suggested have actually been put in to place in regards to the uber application. Full time driving however is very stressful on your car but that would be my only issue.

Sometimes when you don't accept rides for whatever reason (too far away, low rated passenger, needing to clean the car, and etc.) you will be put in a ""time out"" for 5 to 10 minutes.  As well, in certain markets drivers will request rides to get the competition out of the way so they can get rides as well.  Then a final point the rating of the driver is done by the passenger.

I have put over 10,000 miles on my car in 5 months and need new tires and brakes.  So overall it is a fun job, but if you need this as a full time job you will work very long hours.

I drove in Dallas and in Chicago for a while. The biggest catch is the pay. I worked and worked and worked and the money was never enough to pay rent, bills, and to have a fun night out in the city.

It could be a celebrity, it could be your next door neighbor; your atmosphere is usually what you make it, except for those occasional difficult people that are just not into being happy and or they're getting sick and making a mess in your car, or coming onto you - the unwanted attention is the worst.

Company slow to respond to your concerns.  Dealing with disrespectful riders and the company allowing them to continue to use the platform is an issue. Company seems to be only concerned about the riders and those in upper management.  Since there are so many drivers now you are easily disposable with no recourse.  Sometimes you can wait as long as 2 hours, just too pick up a rider going two blocks away,  A 4$ fare.

A typical day of driving entails picking up many people, asking them how their day is going, keeping the conversation light and fun, and getting them to their destinations in a timely and safe manner. I have learned many cool things from uber driving. The biggest thing I have learned has to be that the constant interactions with different people helps you understand people in general better, and that's pretty cool. You are your own boss so you are the management. Culture is nice, as mentioned earlier, you talk to people and drive and its pretty fun. Hardest part of the job has to be dealing with drunk people at night, but as long as they don't vomit in the car, they are pretty fun too.

Personally I loved being able to work when I wanted and had no commitment to stay, however, Uber does not provide much in the way of training or any type of benefits for being a driver. There is no type of healthcare plan and taxes are a pain in the rear to do. Uber takes out 25% of whatever you make so if you take someone down the street for a $2 fair, you only make $1.50 which is kinda screwed up in my opinion, since the app doesn't keep track of anything other than money earned. I found that unless you work nights and weekend, that the money is not worth it. You end up spending more money on gas and your car that what you make during any week day. So unless you live in a busy area with a ton of people, which is a huge hassle in itself, its really not worth the time and energy. Customers are another issue with the job. Your suppose to be nice to all customers and provide them with a good experience, but i found that a majority of the people in my area are very rude and often look down on Uber drivers. Hardly anyone tips, and  a lot of people are just plain rude; smacking your door against stuff, leaving stains on your seats, cranking the music when you give them the auxiliary chord, and even puking in your car from being too drunk.

Drunk passenger puts in wrong pick up location and acts like your friend while in your vehicle, then gives 1 star rating claiming you picked up from wrong location. Passenger doesn't like the way you look, get a low rating. Uber sends report about how you drove perfectly ( braking, speed, and acceleration) you still get poor passenger rating. Uber doesn't reward a good rating or acceptance rate. Lyft gives 15% bonus. Uber spends all money on board members and hiring tech experts to screw drivers. Uber only gave a 4.5% raise after Lyft reentered Houston market. My car insurance went up over $100 per month for commercial insurance. The market is now flooded with poor quality drivers because the fingerprinting and warrant check were fought against by Uber so the market would get flooded with poor quality drivers, keeping the surge down, therefore more riders are willing to fork out the lower fare.

That doesn't matter when you're a drunk loser who rides in an Uber. They will still give nasty ratings because they're belligerent and insane. Uber will not remove poor ratings or explain why a passenger gives the rating. Most of my trips are 5 stars but when one drunk rated me poorly I complained and they send you a robotic response that doesn't directly answer your issue. When you reply back to them, a different representative responds back to you with another robotic reply. The company pays nothing compared to what you'll be spending on gas and a repair once your car breaks down.

Your day is what you make it. if you have attitude your riders will have attitude. If your rider likes to talk then talk if they are not talkitive then you should not be.

If they had a bad day and don't like you for whatever reason, THEY WILL FIND A REASON TO COMPLAIN. You will have no rebuttal to their complaint. My humble advice if your thinking about driving for Uber is go ahead and do it, but drive at surge times so it's worth your time and have a real job to fall back on."

Also they say the closest online driver will get the request and that is false advertisement(I was parked outside in the driveway when my roommate requested an uber, the request was sent to a driver ten minutes away instead of me).

For one, they send you on fares over 15 minutes away and when you get there it is only a few blocks so basically what you make goes to pay gas getting there and back. If they send you a few each time out and you ignore them then you get a nastygram telling you that you need to keep your acceptance rate up.   If you have a problem with a customer, and you do frequently, then you have no one to talk to except email. There is no phone number because they just don't  care. Currently my account has been suspended for the last two days and they still haven't told me why. No email saying that I did something wrong, no explanation of the issue...nothing. and upon inquiries they just ignored me for the first 24 hours and then finally told me ""too bad you will have to wait"". I could understand if my rating was horrible, but it is above average. This place is a joke when it comes to relationships with their drivers. They promise you up to $35 but most of the time it is like $12 if you drive for 8 hours straight.   Most of the riders are cool, but sometimes they act like you are their subordinate and shouldnt be speaking to them and sometimes, the drunks ones, are impossible to deal with.    Unless you want to work for someone that really doesn't care about you at all...stay away from these idiots. The only benefit is being able to choose your own hours and that is it."

Its not sustainable for drivers. All of the risk is on you as the driver.  There aren't any perks that really matter.  They don't take out taxes so you must be aware of 1099 contract status.  You better have plan and this better be a side gig.  Make sure you have a schedule because freedom can help you or hurt you.  The end game for Uber is to rely on self driving cars.  Don't complain or protest because they are letting you know where the industry is going.  Use your time to get a new skill and pivot.  The train is coming whether you stand in front of it or jump on its coming.

I have  lot of 5 star trips but dont drive often so one bad rating from a drunk jerk brings it way down. They also do arbitraey things like lower your fare for ""poor route"" without bothering to find out that the rider changed their mind.

What did you think was going to happen? You think they would put all their competition out of business and stay cheap? This was a play by big money on Wall Street to eventually fleece your wallet.And....As rates rise towards the cab prices, Uber still rakes in the cash by leasing used cars to their drivers. They then give them the preferred routes and double dip on the commission they receive for doing nothing AND they get a car payment out of the drivers. And somehow they find desperate people that are willing enough to put up with their unethical behavior.They have literally become a monopoly over night. And what do monopolies do when they are unchecked by the people? They price gouge, work and pay they people like dogs and have bad service. Here in Dallas the quality continues to go down.

I make my own schedule which works great with me. The ONLY downside that I don't like is that you don't know where you're going until you pick up your client. I find that annoying and doesn't allow me time to calculate if I have time to do that drive or not. Other than that, I've no true complaints.

Also if anyone gets to a low rating (your fired) customer or driver they can't use Uber. The bad is your car must be less than 10 years old  even if it is in perfect condition.

Plus, they absolutely refuse to add tipping as part of the app even though drivers and riders both constantly request it.

If you want to make a couple hundred dollars on the weekend to supplement your other income, you may be interested, but it's likely not worth it as a full-time job.

Uber summons fresh meat with $500 sign in bonus.  Uber is well aware it is totally stealing from drivers.You find out how cheap and petty your fellow man is, because most dont tip - even when going to LAX and paying $1000on ticket to Europe, they jump out of your car and won't even give you a dollar tip.Uber is only concerned with it's valuation and bringing in investor money.

Likewise, I can sign off at any time, making this the most flexible position I have ever had.I have learned preparedness and time management are key essentials to making a good driver.  My daily goal is to travel to the locations that experience high demand in a time frame that is most equitable, factoring in cost of travel, i.e. fuel, tolls, etc.As an independent contractor, I do not have actual co-workers.  I treat each passenger is not just a customer, but also as my own supervisor.  I want each passenger to feel that they have just received world-class service whenever I am selected as their driver.The toughest part of being an Uber driver is ending a shift.

You can log on to the Uber app from your mobile phone anytime you want to drive.  When you are done driving you simply log off the app until the next time.  They keep track of all of your trips and fares.  You can cash out daily onto a debit card or have direct deposit to a checking account or a pre paid debit card of your choice.

No ability to opt out of programs that do not work for you(Uber pool). You are not an independent contractor, as independent contractors are independent in the sense that they would be free to make decisions regarding who they pick up for starters. The platform will remove you if you get too many bad rides in succession, by that I mean if you cancel too many/don't accept enough, regardless of the merit of your criteria or the conceivable ability to complete that ride. The rating system, although admittedly I have I high rating, is completely broken. Uber continuously gives you bad advice about where to go to make money, continually has rewards with the bar set way too high. The only thing I can gather is that they want to attract people into areas/places where there isn't enough coverage by telling them they'll make money there when in reality it is a dry zone of any drivers for a reason...it is dry.The entire business model is essentially a menagerie of infinitely complicated carrot dangling.

2176,2.0,"Lexington, KY",2016-10-09,,,61,3,"Overall: if you are going to make any good hourly wage, prepare to  drive drunks. Management doesn't care about you ore your situation. You'll get a canned response and no action and there is no number to call about anything.They will reject your application and documents over the littlest things. You can tell how money hungry and greedy they are by the entails and text they send. They will threaten to shut you down for poor reviews but won't require riders to give you feedback if they want to give you a negative review so that you can get better or at least know what aggravated drivers. If you are not driving surge, you can expect to wait around and only get a ride an hour and make $10 while you sent $2 in gas. If you do drive drunks you will frequently get poor rating and strife for no reason ( wanting to blow out your speakers, wanting to talk politics drunk, wanting to stuff 6 or 7people into a 4 passenger vehicle and then arguing about it, erratic ratings for the smallest things, errantic rating for something that reflects on them.The good part is you can make good money quick by driving a limited number of hours a week if you have a lousy paying full time job or you are trying to save up money to buy something, without adding a ton of working hours to your week."

After the uber fee and the fact that i have to put gas in to continue to drive my car.  The work does not match the pay.  Then there is the fact that Uber finds ways to continuously con their drivers.  For example the new instant pay.  It is advertised that u can cash in your earnings up to five times a day.  The cost to do so is 50 cents per transaction.  Why would u offer a perk to drivers but constanly scam them out of money.  It is like signing up to be ripped off.  The service should be free considering im maintaining my car and providing the great customer service that uber expects.  Uber is going down eventually.  It was just a get rich quick idea for the ones up top.  But how can u expect so much quality but have no respect for your drivers.  Without drivers, there would be no uber!

The standard rates return lower than minimum wage for drivers.  Surge rides are the only profitable rides and Uber intends to kill surge rates as it is an ""inconvenience"" to the riders.  Uber has hired a glut of drivers in nearly every market to insure that there is more than ample supply of cars available to meet the demand for rides, thus insuring that the rates will be at standard""no surge"" pricing.Uber's woes have been greatly documented and I won't go into them here.There are a lot of drivers that are either desperate or too math challenged to figure out that they are trading future equity of their vehicles for upfront cash today.

I have completed over 2,200 rides. I have an accounting background and I lost my professional job. Out of desperation, I became a driver for UBER/LYFT. I keep precise records of all income and expense. The bottom line statistics are not at all promising to be a driver. I took precise mileage and earnings figures. For 9 months, I drove 41,291 miles, gross revenues before expenses and taxes were 0.61 cents/mile (including cash/non-cash tips). In my market, average gross revenue for UBER and LYFT is 0.80 cents/mile BEFORE 20% commission paid to UBER/LYFT. Of significance, my gross earnings per mile was 25% higher in 2015 ($1.00/mile), which means that average gross earnings per mile will be LESS in future periods. Thus, my findings at the end of this post are UNDERSTATED.  Earnings include prime time and surge pricing. I worked more than full time for 6 months during all optimal times of the day (12+ hours/day, 5+ days/week). 0.61 cents/mile doesn't sound bad, right? Well, not until you account for all costs.

Keep in mind that you are a contractor and all the liabilities and expenses fall on the driver.  Uber takes 25% and in order to make the minimum wage, you will need to drive a passenger 15 miles minimum.  Insurance company may not cover you if involve in accident if they learned that you are driving for Uber or Lyft.  You will need a ride share insurance.  Keep in mind that you need to keep an 88% acceptance rating and 4.87 star rating to continue to drive for Uber.

So it's better if you just don't make any advance schedule and just drive when there's surge.

Definite transparency issues!!!  Example:  the gas discount card is actually only as good as your debit card. Even though the card is usable in most gas stations, ONLY EXON MOBILE offers an actual discount using that card.  And only if the gas is at a very high price.  There are currently only two Exon Mobie stations in the entire Denver Metro area and there are 5 in the entire state.Ratings:  Research shows that people give higher ratings to people who are culturally  similar to themselves.  The ratings are probably at least somewhat unfair MOST of the time.  Uber should have riders click yes/no to three or four issues and have a comment box below. Anything else becomes spiritually devastating to drivers and to riders. You can't improve your driver rating with this OUTDATED nonspecific, emotion based rating system.

And their rating system makes you always upset, even you do good job driving very safe with good city knowledge car is clean and new passenger also so happy from the ride but after dropping off the rider you will see that you low rated because a lot of nasty passangers in the city,they dont care how you treat them good or bad they still leave you 1 star, which is absolutly annoying and kills your motivation, nowadays a lot of drivers dont wonna drive for uber first of all payment is so low and they really tired from uber's strict rating system."

However, the idea that you can work at any time any day isn't really true. Unless you're doing Uber in a big city, you've got to work big events, weekends and very late at night (midnight - 3am) in order to make decent cash. Even then, it's barely enough to live off of if you're relying on it as your sole income. There's also no help with gas or car maintenance, their GPS system is really unreliable and will sometimes take you to the wrong place to pick a customer up, which results in you either driving 15 minutes to lose a ride and wasting your time or a potentially disgruntled customer who will rate you unfairly. Uber also keeps slashing their rates lower and lower when they already take over 20%. They take 20% of the overall bill, then add an additional fee that can be almost 10%, so they're really taking more like 30% while you pay for everything and your car gets a lot of wear and tear. While I did overall enjoy my Uber experience, the pay was sporadic and unreliable, I had to drive late late nights and sometimes customers would (rarely, but it does happen) have me drive them to very dangerous parts of town in the dead of night. There is also no feedback from riders, so if they give you a 1 star- and keep in mind if you drop below 4.6 out of 5 stars you're off the road- you don't get any feedback to know what you even did wrong.

The minute that you speak up, or something does not go their way, ""poof"" you're gone!  I mean gone, with no say in the matter and no one to plead your case to.  I drove for the evil empire for over a year.  We had a bad storm in our town one week and I went over the prescribed number of hours recommended by the PUC.  Not a violation mind you, just an internal guideline that UBER put in place.  Not tested or validated in any way that I could see.  I was immediately deactivated from their platform.  I visited the local office and got a bunch of smoke and mirrors BS from a very incompetent staff.  The people that work at the local office, from what I've gathered make GOOD money.  They are the dregs and rejects from the tech industry and landed a position that pays them well.  They're not about to mess that up.  I was summarily deactivated, my email account, driver account everything!  I don't believe UBER owns 1 telephone.  So not having your e-mail account, good luck trying to get in touch with anyone at a corporate office or an HR office to plead your case.  This is the biggest bunch of BS I've ever seen.  I'm not a sour grapes drive, this is just an unjust crock of !&*!  I did over 3,500 rides and maintained a rating of 4.8....not an amateur or chump by any measure.  Pure BS company."

I live in Lexington, KY and the $ and demand for fares can drastically fluctuate from day to day and demand times change throughout each day of the week.  In a larger city the demand is constantly higher, so there is more money to be made. Be prepared to work a lot of nights if you really want to earn top money."

Rating system dysfunctional.",15,2,"My area of Massachusetts, it just the college students that make you the limited amount of money. When there away forget it, it a morgue. There's a reason Uber is always looking for drivers. The passenger rating system, with intoxicated passengers. Uber tells you your rating has dropped below 4.60 out of 5 stars, and they expect you to pay $100.00 for one hour and thirty minutes of listening to someone on the phone telling you how to get your rating higher. My rating was 4.62 & fell to 4.50 after several months. Then the intoxicated college students rate me for this one night and my rating fell to 4.34 stars. I refuse to pay some donkey associated with Uber, who suppose to get my rating up. Uber does not consider the source. Intoxicated college students. I've thrown 4/5 groups of intoxicated out of my vehicle over the past several months. You see ads on Craigslist, Indeed, CareerBuilder, etc telling you can make just under 500. ya right! There are other driving positions listed in the above mentioned and pay more and there part time as well. The fair for Uber drivers was a minimum about $5.00 for a short trip. Uber lowered the minimum so that same short trip is worth $3.00 for the driver. Long timers with Uber were looking else where as well."

Dealing with rude and intoxicated people is not pleasant either. Uber does not limit the amount of drivers in each city therefore you are competing with other drivers for ride requests. The demand for rides is not enough in Bakersfield to achieve good compensation. Uber always gets their 20 percent cut so they do not care about how much each individual driver is making.

Average ride for me was $7-$8.00 then Uber takes their cut.   Sometimes you sit 90 minutes waiting for the next pick up or worse, traveling up to 28 miles and client cancels pick up on you.

Gotta know how to work it and you gotta hustle. Every morning I go out I intend on making at least $150 that day. I hit 220 once. Most days I hit my mark, sometimes a lil less sometimes more. I put $30 a day in the tank, $6 a day towards insurance, $2 each day out I put on my data plan to stay online. I put about$100 a day in my pocket, depending on how much coffee, cigarettes, and lunch I consume. That times 4, 5, 6 times a week, depending on how motivated I am, means somewhere around $500 a week after expenses. I'm 50, allergic to real work, and I don't make car payments so driving for Uber in Chicago is a cool gig for me. Bills are paid and I stash a lil cash, that's what's up.

When I switched cities to El Paso, it took about two months to sort out everything so I could actually drive again.  There were a lot of issues with technical support, nobody responds to emails or has any clue what to do to help.  If you need to switch cities, just deactivate and start again from scratch.  In a city like El Paso, where Uber is not as popular, you will get requests very rarely and will lose money most days due to the distance traveled to answer a call.  Uber skims a lot of money from the fare, which is especially rough when you have to travel 12 miles for a request, only get $7 to drive a few miles, and then wait in you car for two hours for another request."

Keep records of your expenses because those are tax write offs. Gas, oil changes and any other maintenance. Also keep track of your mileage. In most cases that's the best write off , around 50 cents a mile. Or you can write off depreciation on you vehicle. There are options when it comes to doing your taxes. But remember your technically self-employed so you will have to pay taxes on the money you make that's why you want to make sure to keep records so you get those tax write offs. Find the hot spots in your area. That's where the money is. Drive during peak times. Don't complain about auto insurance cause if you own a car you've got to pay that anyway. I always ask my riders if that want me to use my NAV or do they have a better route.  On my first day I worked less than 3 hours and put $55 in my pocket. Spent $6 in gas. You do the math. You can make money if your smart about it. You might have to drive a little further to go to surge areas but you make that money back fastRecently in Chicago due to bad weather there was a three times regular fee surge in certain areas.

The Driver is totally screwed.  The Driver(s) pay for own gas, car washes, and maintenance.  I'm finding myself having to get oil changes bi-monthly.  Most weeks I can only Uber 4 days of the week because I don't have enough money for gas the rest of the week, and I don't make enough and have to rely on food stamps to eat.  I was renting a smartphone from Uber for $10/week.  They suddenly they upped it to $15/week with nothing stating they would ever be doing. that.  Many drivers I know were talked into leasing cars for $500 - $600 a month and most can't afford that payment.  A Driver I know lives in a weekly hotel with his wife because he was one with a leased car with high payments and can't afford to come up with a security deposit and rent.  You get passengers in your car who will act like it's their car and not respect it or give you a bad rating for no good reason.  Uber encourages Riders NOT to tip the Drivers.  Some passengers still tip, but only if they have cash on them (which most don't) since they can't put it on the credit card affiliated with their account.  Tips are truly appreciate as they help pay for the car washes, gas, wear and tear, a meal and everything else an Uber driver has to afford on it's own.The ONLY way I know of to contact Uber by a Driver or a Rider is via an e-mail.  They tend to be very secretive and impersonal.

They keep on cutting fares time after time at the same time they increase a service fee for insurance to the riders.  needless to say , the driver is the big looser.  Uber can dispose of their drivers at will, even though they've done the job right.  They make you accept 80% of trips, even though  you have to drive a lot of miles to pick up the passenger and because you  never know the final destination, you just get $ 2.50 for that ride. Add all the gas,  vehicle depreciation/wear and tear, and you'll  luckily end up breaking even.driver customer service is a joke. If you have a problem, better let it go or face chatting with robot like customer service reps who always answered the same script without providing any solutions. trust me, unless you have no skills at all, you'll make more money working minimum wage someplace else."

They offer 100 dollars to get people to drive...why would I want to put more drivers on the road. Less business. They claim we would get more rides if costs were less. How many rides can you give in an hour? same amount I could give for more money in the past. Rides come up on screen saying client pickup is 10 minutes away initially. That changes 15-18 minutes after you accept the ride. We do not get paid to go pick the person up, We get paid to drop the person off only.

Yeah, the passenger pays for the tolls to their destination but who pays for toll on your way back? You do!!!!the driver. The only one who comes out winning is the passenger and Uber. This is crazy, Listen to this. One Saturday night I dropped off this passenger at his destination. That same night I had about six to seven more passengers I picked up. The next day around 6 pm  almost 17 hrs later I found a black men's leather wallet with money, credit cards, pictures and other personal items. I contacted uber and the rightful owner about the wallet. Uber said I should return the wallet to the owner. I didnt mind returning the wallet, I asked uber if they are going to reimberse me for the trip witch I was about 10 miles away. They told me I should be checking to see if any riders left anything behind. "" Are they kidding me"". I always ask the passengers to make sure they have all their belongings. Anyway , long story short. Uber did not pay for my for the 20 mile round trip I had to make to return the wallet. I went out of my way to return the wallet. Uber should slightly  increase their fare rates to keep their drivers happy. The only ones who are happy  are the passengers and Uber."

The law prohibits anyone who receives compensation to transport passengers from driving more than 10 hours during a shift. Uber says drive more than that because that's what you are going to have to do to make good money. Uber lies about the ratings system keeping the service safe. Drivers are encouraged to rate riders and decline requests from riders with low ratings. If a driver cancels a lot of trips or frequently gives riders low ratings their acceptance rating which is issued by Uber will begin to decline. Maintaining an acceptable rating is difficult because Uber has created a market where people expect 5 star, V.I.P. service with free gum, mints, water, door & curb service at .99 cent store prices & no tip.

Keep in mind that your on a rating system which is corrupted.

After much bribing of money and ""please every other uber driver allows it"" They finally abide with ordering additional UBER vehicles for pick up.

The Uber app that is used to maintain the riders location and destination should be upgraded. The app only gives you a general location of the rider's location if they are in an apartment complex. It would also be nice if Uber let the drivers know where the rider's destination is. In case you need to stop and get gas or have to refuse the trip. The company does answer your questions rather quick and adjust your rates if needed.

I don't feel like this job is really worth it. Something is better than nothing, but yeah I feel I'm better off getting a real job.

The management I work with don't understand the differences between an independent contractor and employee as I am given a lot of benefits employees get, but without the compensation and title. I asked for a raise recently but it was declined, as I was told raises are given to Uber employees based on performance (and I am not an Uber employee!).

One other very large factor is that Uber is operating ""illegally"" in Broward and Miami Dade county's.

Getting a hold of Uber for help is only done by email and can take a long time for a response. Email responses are cut and paste answers.  Navigation is done by air miles when notified of a  call but the road miles will always be longer where it doesn't make sense to take the call.  Every time I work in a hilly area  I get an email the next day telling I am turning down too many calls and threatened to be deactivated. I would like the CEO or any managers to drive for a month and to see how it really is!! We are constantly being threatened of subtly reminders that we can be deactivated. No immediate help is available. Rates are lowered with no warning and if you want to make good money you have to work late at night on weekends. Uber will change auto requirements with no warning.  Many a driver had been left holding a car that he has to pay for that management decided for no good reason it is not good enough for their business.  I am talking about cars like a Lincoln Town Car.  It is good for working when you want and where you want but sometimes where you want to work has very little business.  Feast or famine pay.

When I contacted Uber for assistance with the app. I tried to explain to them that it lost satellite reception, and what did they do?They said your rating is 4 star and you are deactivated.

You start and stop the ride on your phone, and rely on a GPS map to get you to your client, and where they desire getting dropped off at.  What I learned was a little more about the independent contracting issue and taxes, and keeping great records for what mileage, gas, and other related expenses for your personal vehicle.  There is self management besides the surge hours of when people use Uber the most during the day.Co-workers, I never met any except the person that I referred to drive with me.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with a lot of out of people with all different walks of life.

They undercut drivers in order to compete and drivers will earn next to nothing after maintenance cost. They also are extremely arrogant and very rude people. They will never contact you by phone to solve any problems and you will never be able to speak to anyone by phone if you need driver support or any questions. It is also not a good contract because they terminate you based on statistics alone without any notice and without any input from you as a driver. Such a relationship is onesided as such an agreement is squed to mostly their benefit. With such an uncertainty with regards to a continuous and regular income I would never recommend this Comany Uber to anyone.

Passenger paid $15.10 for a ride that lasted 39 minutes of time and engine running. After UBER's cut, I got $11.28!   She had me stop to pick up her daughter along the way to Chipotle.  Passenger and I wait 15 minutes for daughter to come out from her event. But then not just her daughter but three kids got in my car. So now I have 4 passengers . We go to Chipotle and I wait for them 15 minutes to get food and then take them back to their hotel.  I complain to Uber that we had multiple stops and 4 passengers and they didn't pay for return fare from Chipotle back to the hotel. Uber's response:1) we allow 4 passengers for the same fare2) You got paid for your time, if you made them pay a separate fare for the return trip, it would have amounted to the same anyway.  Really!! Really!??  If that is the case, driving for UBER is a money and time loosing venture for drivers. Consider this - you have an accident with a passenger on board, its your own insurance that has to pay - Uber's kicks in only if when your own insurance policy is depleted. If your passenger gets hurt, you can be sued.  If your car insurance finds out you were using your vehicle for business, your rates will go way up negating any money you made for years! DON'T DO IT, GREAT FOR RIDERS BUT A WASTE OF YOUR TIME, YOU WON'T MAKE ANY MONEY AND VERY HIGH LIABILITY FOR YOU AND YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE.

My expenses driving a small SUV getting 20 miles to the gallon calculates to 25 cents a mile which covers depreciation, insurance, expected repairs, oil and gas.  This estimate, I believe, is on the conservative side.    On Friday, I worked 5 hours in an Uber “hot zone” where Uber says 50 percent of their business in my area comes from.  The only time I left this area was to take a couple to the airport 25 miles away.  Leaving the airport, I did not get another ping/fare until I had entered back into the “hot zone” again.  In the five hours I picked up a total of 7 fares for a total pay of $68.08.  When you subtract my expenses of 25 cents per mile, driving 159 miles for the day, my net income was $5.66 an hour.  One of my fares I was pinged four miles from the pickup location, which took me thirteen minutes to get there.  Three college students hopped in my car and wanted a ride two miles down the road, for a total of six miles.  After deducting my expenses, this fare only netted me $1.70 for almost 20 minutes of work.    On Saturday, November 1st I worked three hours and fifty minutes back in the “hot zone”, only turning my ride application off for a five minute bathroom break and I picked up a total of 5 fares for a net income of 13.25. I now worked two days for a total of eight hours and forty five minutes and earned less than five dollars an hour.  And Uber wants me to serve my riders cold bottled water too?

Not true.... MAYBE on VERY busy nights the company will GROSS $25 an hour off you but in my opinion that doesn't count as me MAKING $25 an hour.... Of that you are left with 80%... Then subtract about 15% for gas with all the empty miles.... And wear and tear on your car!!! So I've taken my net after uberS cut, subtracted my gas based on total miles driven on shift and average MPG, and I have figured I am making about $9-$10 an hour. Not bad right? WRONG.... That's only after gas.... That doesn't consider the wear and tear on your own vehicle!! Depreciation! Oil changes, which you will need about once a month! Tires, don't get a flat tire or your wage will drop to about $.50 cents an hour for the rest of the night!.... If you have a car payment then you'll really be poor!.... To make $1,000 a week with them means you will have to work 70-100 hours that week! And put about 1,500 miles on your car with no flat tires! Don't believe me? Just do the simple matter of fact math. Here in Charleston SC they charge $1.75 a mile.... They take 20%... So we get $1.40 a mile.... I've figured out that most of the time you have 50% of your miles driving empty to pick up the next fare. But let's underestimate and say only 40% of miles are driven empty (if you get really lucky)... So that means out of total miles driven you are grossing, before any maintenance or gas, $.84 cents every mile you drive.

They take only rating from clients and can deactivate your account at anytime. Meanwhile, they make money off you while you pay for their app, pay for your gas and incur wear and tear on your car. They will never communicate with you as a driver. So beware. Remember all those crazy drunk folks at night?Yes, They listen to these folks saying you are no good although you gave them the best ride quality. DO NOT JOIN UBER. They lie about the 4000 monthly fares. You will never earn that muchThey will use you and spit you out.

Most drivers make far less than that, around $1,500. Uber will tantalize drivers from time to time by temporarily increasing driving fares, but it is an artificial incentive that is always short-lived.  The reality is that one spends many physically exhausting hours of driving making very little pay.  The City is fast-paced and stressful and those who are not well versed in maneuvering through the congestion of San Francisco in the middle of high congestion peak traffic periods should look elsewhere for part-time work.  It is possible to make a little more with a black, higher end car, like a Lincoln or Lexus, but the driver must possess a CA PUC issued TCP (which is about $1500 a year) plus pay for commercial insurance every month which is about $1,000.

Their legal department came up with this euphemism so that when you smash into a pedestrian while driving they can argue in court that you aren't actually an employee!(1) Be prepared to put 60,000 miles/year on your car if you do this full-time. How much will you need to make to compensate for that vehicle depreciation? How much will this wear and tear cost you in maintenance? Please run the numbers.(2) Be prepared to pay for the iPhone they provide you -- they are currently charging $40.00/month for a ""data plan"" which is really a disguised way of stealing more of your %. Even if you do not turn on this iPhone at all during a month, you will pay! Brilliant, now they are incentivized to pass out as many of these iPhone as possible -- eventually they can start their own cellphone company with the revenues! Oh, and you will also have to pay for your own smartphone in order to communicate with riders since the Uber iPhone is only an interface to receive calls for rides!

It's sad to say the least, how drivers must experience the unethical tactics they use as a corporation. Uber used to take 20% from the fare. Now, they are taking up to nearly 50%. How is this possible when they have no operating costs, such as fuel, wear & tear, etc?  They introduce new fees such as booking fee, destination fee, software usage fee, rider fee. They keep 100% of these fees in addition to taking anywhere from 30%-50% of the total distance and time fee the driver receives! When you ask management what mathematical formula they use to calculate total earnings for the driver, they can't answer that for you because they have no clue. Management also has an unprofessional approach on stereotyping drivers. They assume drivers are uneducated and ignorant to company policy and tactics. When I visited a Green-light Hub recently, it was only after I discussed my only intention of working for Uber at the moment was because I was working towards my Post-Grad Degree. The manager quickly changed his attitude and began speaking to me in a different manner, more sophisticated and professionally I might add. That is the hardest part of the job - holding up that shield. However, what really keeps me going are the customers. I love to have conversations with riders and explore their backgrounds and future endeavors they might have.

I looked at him and said really ! I was told that it would be 150.00 or more depending on where the rider threw up at in the car. He didn't ask to see the pictures that I had talking of the mess in my car. So I went and spoke with someone else and the young lady that I talk with said wow he wouldn't look at this ? Well she paid me for the throw up 90.00 which I fell it should have been 150.00. I will add that she was more professional then the rude male was. I will say that Uber made me feel uncomfortable being a driver with a couple of incident.

Which can be very scary for female drivers. Then there is the nasty  job of cleaning your car after someone had vomited . However Uber does compensate the drivers for cleanup. Working as a Uber Driver has I created my Family Time. However I had to stop driving for Uber because of the age of my car. Which drastically decreased my income.

As of October 18th, 2018 Uber cuts drivers rates in Chicago to 0.60 cents per mile (think: your average, overhead cost per mile is at least 0.30 cents per mile).

Try to go to the store and tell the cashier I'll pay with Uber points or I give you just 5 stars rating for the grocery. ????!!!!!!

I learned how to get to places in a whole new way,     At Uber I learned short cuts, and the long routes to a destination. Management was little to none which was great! and Uber has a great workplace cultur.     The hardest part of working with Uber was they did not give gas allowances as they had promised, therefore you were not making any money your money made with Uber was going right back into the gas tank which meant you were working for free."

But if an average rating is 4.7 stars and anybody who has a rating below that gets fired is evidence of unrealistic expectations on the part of the company.

Neither Uber or Lyft regulates how many drivers can be in any area, so it does not encourage longevity, unless you develop a personal client base or start operating against the rules, which I have heard a lot of people do.

They looked into my account and concluded it as FRAUD for waiting for customers to receive their food. STUPID DUMB IDIOTS!!!1. The Uber Computer System will flag your account if you delivery ""late"" which means WAITING FOR A CUSTOMER. So basically, you don't have TIME to wait for a customer to answer the door to retrieve their food/items. The Computer System cannot measure situations that are beyond your control such as waiting for customers, calling customers to answer the door.2. Not to mention they will deactivate your account WITHOUT warning. They pulled the rug beneath me without warning. If this is a source of income for you - better watch out! It's not stable or reliable. 3. The GPS system is really bad. It will not give you exact location of the house, apartment, warehouse, etc. Apartment complexes are the worse! Very inaccurate. 4. You sometimes will deal with rude and drunk people.5. You sometimes will not receive a tip.6. Delivering in the rich areas are the best. Watch for hood or bad areas.7.

But soon learned you do ALOT of driving for nothing. You drive for long pick ups only to drive the customer one block. So I drove 18 miles to pick them up and then 1 blockto there house. Leaving me 18 miles in nowhere. Constantly fighting for your surge fares that you are Definitely in and pick up but replies to support states the surge dropped. This company surely only cares for itself. Not the riders and certainly not the drivers!  So I have taken a 6 month brake and might start driving again. Only if the riders knew how much we got paid. Riders should have to rate drivers after ride just as drivers do. As the evening goes on their UBER rides mix together and some UBER drivers go above and beyond and I think get mixed up and get a low rating occasionally.

Usually turns out to be about $15-$25 per hour. I've read a lot that people don't get tipped very often. I didn't either at first.  I decided to order Uber eats a few times to see what others were doing. I was surprised at how unprofessional and sloppy people dressed and acted. I invested in a larger, thinker, nicer thermal bag. Did my make up and hair and dressed nice. I made sure to smile and carry myself well, just in case customers peeked out to see if I was on my way to the door. Always politely say hello as I open the thermal bag, towards them for the aroma. Always look people in the eyes and wish them a good day. I get tipped more than not now.

Taxis charge about $3.50 per mile, which helps offset the cost of maintenance, but Uber was charging under $1.10 per mile, which is less than 1/3 of taxi charges.

Actual drivers shouldn't post unless they've worked more than one season. You cannot survive on what you make. You have to work over 13 hours with hundreds of miles on your vehicle each day to make more than $200 (then deduct a little more than $0.50 per mile for depreciation, as per federal rates; gas; maintenance (will need regular oil and tire maintenance, not including the unexpected); and sometimes tolls back to your location). You can end up in the negatives (meaning you will actually lose money) if you're not selective about the rides you accept. I recommend looking for other, viable work while doing this. I can't believe their pay rates haven't been outlawed yet; rideshare is not that new anymore and the government is either being lazy or are using the rideshare services too much and don't want to act (a clear conflict of interest). They take way more than 20% or 25% of fares like I've seen some others mention (more like 50-60%). They fight governments that urge them to pay livable wages without considering taking lower cuts that would still make them billions (they instead claim they would have to charge passengers higher fares to pay better - so greedy).

Do not get paid enough to make up for what we spend. We are not a limo so it's should just be a ride to point  A to point B. We should not have to be rated because this is our own business. There are drivers out there that take cash for rides which cheats the rides for the rest of us. You need to be customer service savvy and make conversation with your riders. People are rude sometimes and lie when they rate us. We should know who gives us a below 5 rating so we can go back and give them the same. It would be nice for Uber to support us especially when we have been driving for a long time. Uber should be more considerate of us drivers that are out there every day making them money. Gas prices have risen and Uber should consider taking care of their drivers by paying us more like they use to years back. Uber should care more about their drivers.

You will be putting a lot of miles on your car.  It's a great thing to do if you have extra time to spare.  I do it to pay for the gas and keep me busy while my kids are in school because I drive them 100 miles each day.  I will say, it is hard to get anything else done if you want to stay busy with UBER, you have to stay on the app and you may start a task or even try to stop and eat and you get a pop up.  Typical work days for me are about 4 hours during surge lunch time.  I can make around $30-$50 /day.  So the same as min. wage.  However, you are driving a lot, climbing stairs, getting in inclement weather at times.  And people don't usually tip so don't count on that.  If you can handle it with the less than pleasing crowds and long waits at McDonalds on a Saturday night, you can make some good money.  However, the drive threw is usually very long in the location you need to go to make money.  So, a typical run may take 30 or more minuets but your surge time is great so it pays off.

I have learned not to judge a book by it cover, and to be a very good listener, as well as more patience. Management seems to be doing a good job when there is an issue with something they seem to jump on it as quick as possible and get it resolved. The workplace culture is great it is very diverse which is quit interesting and enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult riders that try to get over on their fair. The navigation could be much better it tends to take you out of the way at times unnecessarily The other thing is not getting paid for a job that you know cost more than what they were charged. The last thing is dealing with traffic and bad drivers on the road. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility it has that is awesome. The other thing is at times the pay rocks and you don't have to work for eight hours to earn it. .

It was still embarrassing though and the car smelled for few days.Payment is inconsistent, you will hardly get tips, some riders will take advantage of the the ride and will put one location that is close, then ""change"" their mind and boom you find yourself driving much further than you wanted to, specially because go find someone"

The ""ride payment"" is always much less than the fare. It is possible to pick up and drop off 7 people on an Uber pool and make only $18 because drivers are only paid 75% of the ""ride payment"", an amount that is derived from a combination of time and distance and has absolutely no relation to the fare. Because riders also have the impression that drivers are making the fare minus the 25%, they believe that drivers are making more than they are, and, so they don't tip as much.

A Lux  car in this case.The money that uber pays to a driver after their fees is not yet net earnings. Not yet deducted gas, car worn  out, time invested during trip and connected before the trip, tax and other deductions.

I'd make about 650-750 a week with surges and promotions I just moved to las vegas and the surges and promotions aren't like they are in los angeles. With that being established I can say I'm relearning where to park my car and wait for rides. If you drive for uber you know its hit or miss with the fares. In las vegas I've noticed that most my pickups are at the airport and I get decent trips when I accept rides at LAS airport. I havent made what I made in los angeles but the potential is there if you put in an 8 hour work day you can make atleast $100 not bad if you drive smart ! Learn where theres alot of fares being requested. Find the locations where events are going on and capitalize on that!

Occasionally I will drive around the area to see if there are any customers in different spots.I have learned that Uber hours are specific. However, the safety part of the job depends on the hours you work as well. For instance, working later hours when more drunk people are out can potentially be dangerous. On the other side, you get more business working later hours compared to earlier ones.Uber doesn't require any management which is a prop. I think management can be somewhat stressful and with that comes small mistakes that are being made.The workplace culture comes in a wide variety.The hardest part of the job is managing your own hours. This is because there are times when you are waiting for hours for a person to use Uber and you just want to go home.The most enjoyable part of Uber is having more days off to do what you like.

For example, passengers will try to sneak beer or extra passengers into the car, will try to get in your car even though you are not their uber driver, and will be rude for no reason. You have to know what your limits are and your threshold for tolerating someone's behavior or kicking them out and canceling the ride. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have really nice passengers and then it is like driving around your friends.

Waiting for a rider to request a ride fluctuates cause you may be busy with riders back to back and sometimes you can have days where you are waiting 10 or more minutes for a rider to request a ride. When there are a lot of Uber drivers, the possibility to receive a ride is a lot slower so you make less money even while working in the peak hours. I enjoy the liberty of being my own boss. I got to travel in Tulsa, Oklahoma City, and Dallas,Texas when working for Uber. I enjoyed being able to work in a bigger City like Dallas in which was more busier than working in Tulsa. I rarely see the other Uber drivers around however we often wave at each other and that is good camaraderie.

There is a comradery among Uber drivers, so i guess the culture would be very positive as they have private communities on facebook for Uber drivers only to share and help each other out with questions and concerns. The hardest part about the job is putting the miles on your vehicle. The wear and tear is not made up with the compensation from the fares you get. I think Uber can give their drivers a little more of the pie to compensate for that part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is chatting with interesting people along the drive to their destination.

I only do UberEats deliveries because I get the heebies about having strangers in my car.2. This was my second job to the 9-to-5 so it's great that I can work whenever. I usually do a couple of dinner deliveries on my way home from work and full-day shifts on Sat/Sun. It's a good side gig for some extra money however, I would not recommend for anyone trying to pay their bills through this job.3. Driving a tiny, super fuel-efficient car and not having to cut too much into the bottom line for gas is the lifeline. If you drive a gas guzzler, you might not be making much after you pay for gas and any food for longer shifts.4. Split your shifts by meal time and plan to do other things in between. Even on the weekends, there are times when delivery requests aren't pinging back-to-back. Stay near busy areas with lots of restaurants, but don't waste gas and drive around. I got one of those inflatable backseat mattresses for quick naps during those breaks, no joke :)5. Even with those breaks, I still average well-above minimum wage per hour at the end of the day. It just depends on the area you're at and how much time you're willing to put in, and sometimes, sheer luck.6. Most people don't tip you, so don't bend over backwards for these people--just smile and move on to your next delivery."

They only let you do 2 deliveries within 1 hour, so you're sitting there in a parking lot waiting to go deliver...nothing.

It is crucial to sustain great customer satisfaction and the best part about why I think I can always continue to do so is because I am the boss. I am fully responsible for everything but I actually am not afraid of a challenge. This job can be quite challenging at times due to many factors but if you are positive, motivated, and smart then you can overcome those challenges and make the profit you desire!!!"
3254,1.0,"Spokane, WA",2018-05-08,Self Employed,UberSucks,7,2,"Only drive for Uber if you are desperate for money. The pay is low. The wear and tear on your vehicle is expensive. Things will start out great but become very much not-so-great once you realize how much it actually costs you in the long run. The gas is expensive and the tips are low. Most times you will make below minimum wage. Uber will treat you great at first but at the drop of a hat, they will start costing you money and become unresponsive. The support center is in a different country and they could care less about the drivers. Average McDonald's run is about $3.50 and if you decline one, you could be given three to four McDonald pings in a row. Restaurants are slow and hate Uber and drivers. They will constantly make you wait long for food that your customers will ultimately blame you for being cold."

I continue to drive for the company and I am thankful for the opportunity to serve others and get paid too.  When I drive I meet a lot of interesting people, most have a story about their journey through life.  Many have blessed me with knowledge and I have also had the opportunity to do ministry work while driving.  When I am not with a passenger, I can also help my sisters and brothers that are homeless by passing out care bags that include daily necessities such as food and water.  You cannot imagine how many one can pass by on a corner before or after you drop off your client, so I try to take the time to help another...making most of my time.  I feel like it is double ministry work...serving man-kind.   I also have had instances where riders have revealed their troubles and by the time the ride is done have a calming thought about how to approach such life challenges.  I believe that I was guided to do this work as a an opportunity to help others, learn, as my navigational skills were un-worthy in the beginning and now, I can say I am quite familiar with the city.  Unfortunately,  Uber has received many negative vibes about the company, but when I hear such, I remind them that it is one of the largest companies world wide that has employed many to better their situations and the flexible hours to support and raise a family.  I have recommended Uber to many, and will continue to.  I am truly thankful for the opportunity...as it continues to serve me"

The fuel costs eat away at your total earnings for the day. Airport runs are a joke in the queue area. Your better off not trying that. The days that pay is good seems to align with tips and not because uber pays well. Customers are great however! Overall I can say if you do drive for uber don’t do it as a primary source of income.

Uber X has some potential, but overall you will lose money- I guarantee it. Never waste a minute with eats. This the biggest scam ever. They will short you on your pay, which can be fixed by messaging them through the app or calling driver support that have representatives from another country who have no idea what they are doing. I've had to call any a daily basis whenever I did eats. It was drop off fees most of the time that I did not receive, and sometimes I. Was short by 50 cents, which I could never figure out how or why this occurred. I could not call the support anymore for all the small increments missing because the time and effort was not worth it. Extremely shady business. I know you have no reason to take what I am writing seriously, if you you spend some time looking up all the Uber scandles, you will see how sinister this company is.

The company has a lot of drivers and they compete against each other at busy times. The problem with Uber is some of the drives you pick up are for a very low wage and the customer has the option to tip but it is uncommon unless for events or when tourists tip. You need to get very familiar with the best ways to achieve the most you can earn and that is through studying and tips from other drivers. You also need to be aware that sometimes the customer will try to put extra passengers in your car to avoid the higher charge with a bigger car. Passengers also will hit on you if you are attractive and you just have to be professional and tell them NO.

Sitting in your car all day, fighting through traffic, dealing with sometimes difficult pax, putting thousands of miles on your car (RAPID depreciation), waiting for ride requests, etc. Eating fast food, clenching while you hope for a nearby place to use the bathroom - this is the life of a full time driver.

If you want to know what drivers think of the shady, shady company and treatment of drivers, check out online forums like uberpeople.Also, whatever you do, don't get into a Rideshare lease or long-term rental agreement; they then OWN you. Do this only if you already own an economical, low-maintenance vehicle.FYI, LYFT used to have the reputation of being more ethical and considerate to it's drivers. That may have been the case once, but nowadays, whatever one of them does, the other copies, but I consistently make more driving UBER because there's more riders = more surge pricing, less waiting for & shorter drives to ride requests.

It now offers the opportunity for its partners (drivers) to purchase insurance coverage, an automobile and auto insurance, etc.  It also tries to express its appreciation for the hard work of its five star partners.  For example, when I recently had difficulty with the UBER Help Line, a manager called to discuss the matter with me directly.  He apologized for the incorrect information having been given to me.  He also sent me a follow-up appreciation note.  His response, to my concerns, was outstanding.UBER's pay structure to partners, leaves a great deal to be desired.

Here is an actual example. 15.7 mile trip. 32 minutes, 50 seco ds. Rider  paid $31.55. Only $14.79 is paid to me. $16.76 is ubers share!!!. It is not feasable or reasonable for anyone to be able to furnish the car, the cell phone, the fuel,  and take in less than 50% of the fare. So glad I did not purchase a car to drive for this company. The app worked fine except for a glitch in connecting via phone or texts to the rider/pickup. It was corrected on day 2. Another huge pay problem is the very long wait times between clients. I spent 8 hours my first day. 4 rides paying just under $50. So far today over 2 hours and one 8 dollar fare.

I concluded that UBER is more or less an artful cyberspace inspired scam.  the main thing that is noticeable is you cash out the best years(mileage) of your car for pennies plus you deliver great service on top of that all to net less than minimum wage. I think the USgovernment needs to investigate this. UBER is building its take over of the world in a cyber logistics fashion on the backs of unsuspecting people such as me.

However, driving for UberX means that there are a lot of short rides that will pay out less than $5, making the trip almost seem not worth it. There are also times where there are little to no requests, or the requests come in slowly, so more hours have to be put in to make a decent amount of money by the end of the day.Overall, if you're looking for a side-job, or a way to make extra money, go for it.

You can basically work anytime and you are in control of how much you work. For the most part it is fun, especially since I strictly drive on the weekends and cater to individuals that go on ""Night Outs"". To me it's only worth driving around these times since there's a demand and also since I do not have to deal with the traffic here in Los Angeles. It's great that Uber now has a method to tip drivers using the app and also the incentives for driving more are certainly a motivator especially late at night. Would I ever do it full time? Unfortunately, NO! The fact that Uber does not provide benefits and paid time off makes it very challenging. Would I continue to drive for Uber part-time......absolutely! It also helps that our neighborhood is at a decent area of the Valley and surrounded by some of the most affluent neighborhoods and cities of Los Angeles & Ventura County which means I get to drive close to home. The riders out here are much more pleasant compared to other areas. Basically, they know how to have a good time but not go over board to the point that they start ""puking"" and trashing your car. As a driver, as long as you can carry a good conversation (or know how to shut up when the rider is not in the mood to chat), not a ""creep"" and ultimately just be aware of your riders ""mood"", you will get rated highly. Bottom line, it's a customer service job and 99% of the time if you respect your riders, they respect you back. Overall it's not a bad gig at all!"

Need to be witty and thick skinned at times to tolerate some passengers.  However, bad passengers only represent about 5% of the total.

Many would slam my door once leaving, curse at me if I took the wrong directions by mistake, eat and drink without permission, children jumping up and down on the seats, parents refusing to supervise their children to name a few.These were the passengers who would mostly give me a low rating. However, my experiences were not all challenging. Many passengers engaged in healthy, educated conversation about politics, sports, marriage, children, employment and they were generous in rating me and giving excellent tips."

You can work it from your own car and be your own boss, too! I also get to hear all about all the great restaurants and bars and night clubs from my riders, as well as hear interesting stories and meet all different kinds of people from every walk of life. My biggest complaint about it, though, is no paid time off and no benefits if you are driving full time. It puts a lot of miles on your car, but luckily, they provide apps to help you manage your healthcare through healthcare.gov and it also tracks your mileage for you."

Literally, the only number you could call was 911. If you needed to contact an Uber representative, you had to do so via email; which of course is hard and illegal to do while driving. Even when you do email Uber Partner support, it takes at least 15 sent emails until you get an actual response and not an automated template response that doesn't answer any of your issues.

3685,3.0,Florida,2017-08-30,Work anytime you want. No set schedule.,Fare payout can be better. Wear and tear on your car,,,I have had just a couple bad experiences. Initially I didn't like the fact that Uber pretty much deterred riders from tipping by the comment on their website stating tips are not required or expected. I am glad that has changed and they now promote tipping. I have had one issue of not getting paid for a trip and Uber wouldn't pay for it because the customer cancelled and I ended up driving them home anyway w/o the knowledge of the cancellation until after trip was over. Very frustrating. Many times the pickup locations are wrong when the rider uses GPS to choose their location. That adds up to a lot of wasted looking for riders. The Uber platform crashes during ride requests and I've lost rides completely because of system issues. Overall I am OK with the working for Uber. It definitely has room for improvement. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting very cool people. I would say that 99% of the people I pick up are very nice people. Uber has helped me stay afloat when I lost my job and I am thankful for them.

We are given as little information as possible. It is also not clear that riders are given the right information about considering pickup location.The app and company will invariably have to work on many of these problem aspects of the company before it transitions to a fully autonomous network of vehicles for its users.With the number of relations missteps that it is undergoing now, it is not clear whether it will have the energy to invest in the more essential aspects of its business model before the transition."

Excellent interaction with customers and the job is attractive because of the flexibility in schedule. Uber does not pay well, however, drivers are encouraged to go the extra mile. Riders almost never tip, even though the option is now available through the app. Drivers are made to feel good by receiving high ratings, but it does not translate into better pay. The company does not do much to protect the interest of its employees. You will spend your own money on gas, vehicle, insurance and auto maintenance but you will not earn enough to make up for all of the related expenses. I find that rider expectations are extremely high, however, they are extremely cheap and the rides are often short. If you love driving and enjoy talking to people, then you may enjoy this work.

Replacing the battery, condenser when the AC went out and a full tune up and countless oil changes ran costs into the thousands.

But the net earnings after taking care of your vehicle and meeting the expectations of the company leaves you in deficit frequently. Additionally, after signing up, Uber retains the ability to make adjustments to your base compensation, typically resulting in loss of income. My experience with Uber has generally been negative. In order to be successful with the brand, you have to work long, varied, and difficult hours, dealing with some of the worst and most drunk people. This takes away the opportunity to maintain a healthy lifestyle and makes it difficult to maintain a positive outlook since so many people are drunk, rude, or sexually inappropriate towards drivers. Finally passenger culture has come to expect to be able to treat the drivers and their vehicles however they feel, even if it demeans the driver's sense of person or risks damaging the vehicle. It does not fall short of being a toxic business relationship."

But most of the time it is fairly consistant with an average wait time under 10 minutes per call.  However, I do not think Uber drivers get paid well enough because there are certain situations that force a driver to drive many more miles to get to the pickup in comparison to how far of a distance that pickup needs to be taken.  When the driver does not have a fuel efficient car these can be very unappealing situations to have to deal with on a regular basis.  the driver should get compensated for how far they have to drive to get to the pickup in the first place."

The best experience is meeting new people from all walks of life. However,  you  begin to realize that everything is technology based, with little to no human interaction with the company. Driver support even at a Greenlight location is non existent. Our market is saturated with former taxi drivers, students, and side hustlers. Add the leased cars, and earnings have dropped significantly. There's off season issues which means you'll need to drive more for the same pay. Be careful of the cars wear and tear. It adds up quickly. The company isn't driver centric, rather rider focused. The rating system feels like a constant job review with no way to rebuttal. Every trip ends only you rate your rider, however, the rider can rate you long after. Promotions have barroers and are tough to achieve unless you're fulltime or in a major city.  Overall,  proceed with caution and understand what you're doing."

All they care about is that you go and make them money, while you do not have any compensation, like healthcare or insurance. Their navigation gave me a lot of troubles with the law enforcement because it deliberately gives drivers illegal turns to take.

If that's not enough to digest then stand by because at the end of the year you will be given a 1099 K and you will have to settle paying taxes on your earned income from Ubering.

To pay a sitter to do dinner runs would mean half my pay. Factor in gas money and I am not making very much.

Once you get there you don't get very many trips....uber must have over anticipated the number of trips for the day....the longer you are online the Driver ap begins to glitch. Only way you can get tech support is through email. To make up for the over expected number of trips they short change the dirvers.....finding ways to say you didn't qualify for the hourly guarantee rate. Very frustrating.....expected to make $100 only made $60. Uber is very unfair to the drivers & customer service is terrible.

I signed up to drive, and drove full time for several months because of my experiences as a rider were excellent. Drivers get the short end of the stick with this company. -Driver support is slim to none; email is the only way to get in touch with the company, there is no phone service (except in Denver, CO). -Fair prices have been cut to the point that most drivers with Uber make less than minimum wage. Yes that's right, less than minimum wage. On top of this tipping is now allowed, but since Uber has not announced this to passengers, it is up to the driver to solicit tips. This usually doesn't end well because Uber has been known up to this point as a non-tipping service.-The Uber driver app is glitchy, so rides get dropped on a daily basis. Rides will disappear due to technical issues, leading to lost fairs, time, and revenue. Imagine working an entire hour at your job, and not being paid a single dime because of a technical glitches. Perks of the job include meeting all types of people, depending on the area you drive in. However this can also be a drag if you don't enjoy interacting with trashy or rude people. Uber lets the passenger rate you and comment on your driver profile but there is only a rating system for customers.All in all this may be a good hobby for you to take up, but using it as a source of income is not advisable."

When I started they did not properly inform me about the insurance coverage. Unfortunately, I got hit during a ride and the other driver did not have coverage. I wasn't aware when I rode share that voids my current insurance and I would have needed to update my personal insurance to include ride sharing which would be too much money. I highly suggest you look into the insurance if you are regularly riding uber. I am a great driver no accidents for 8 years till recently and I will be paying out of pocket. No rentals are offered or uber ride credits to get around while repairs are made. Sucks but its the reality of it."

Drivers must retain a certain rating level to continue driving, which means they want to avoid problematic passengers, or at least have a heads up about what to expect. That’s where passenger ratings come in.Passenger ratings are scores that Uber users (“riders”) have been given by their drivers, and those ratings haven’t thus far been made available to the users; they’re for drivers to see. Many Uber users have wondered what their ratings are, though — maybe they’ve a low rating and it’s why it can be hard for them to get a ride, for example."

You could drive 15 minutes, wait for 5, then your rider only goes down the street for a minimum fare. You make $2.80. Definitely not worth it. If traffic is bad, that means fewer rides for your time, or less money. You get a ticket, it's all on you. Let's be honest, the more you are on the road, the greater the chances of getting a ticket. I don't know what would happen if I was ever in an accident, quit before that happened.You never meet a coworker, you can find them on online forums. I suggest you visit one before starting.

I averaged about $10 per hour including tips, BUT then you subtract taxes, gas and vehicle wear & tear and its more like $7.  The rates are too low and customers are always saying how cheap it is compared to a cab, like 25-50% less in my area!  It's crazy that I'll get a fare 25 minutes away, drive there, then they only want to go a couple miles, get paid $2.50 then drive back to my regular area.  So for an hour of driving I net about $1.00!!!!!!  uber COULD be a great thing but they need to allow drivers to geo-fence an area they will go.  uber will not last much longer if they don't raise their rates to fairly compensate drivers, as of now most drivers wash out in a few months I hear.

It is fun working with the people that get in the car; many of them like music, so it is always good to have an auxiliary cord.

No flexibility problems and could work as much as I want. That bit is true, you can drive for 20hrs a day an no one will stop you. The problem is you'll not only be poor, but in serious debt as well. Just think about it, you pay your car note monthly, pay that costly insurnace, buy your own gas everytime you have to drive, heck even buy your own tires yet you pay uber 28% of all earnings. WHY? What are they doing? Thats not even the problem. The fares are horrible!! Riders out there must be feeling like its Christmas all year round. You'll spend most of your day making SHORT trips driving people a couple of miles away and making the min $5 fare. Off that 5 bucks you'll probably take $2 or less once Uber is done shaving you. Nothing is worse driving somebody around and knowing your probably gonna make 2 dollars on that ride and on top of that, they start telling you about how you took the wrong turn and you trying to cheat them into paying more money. The folks at uber know about all our struggles. Heck we're dancing to their tunes. What heart-breaking is they don't even care if you make money on not. All they want is for you to get on the road and make them money. THE CAR IS YOURS, YOU PAY FOR IT!! USE IT WISELY. EVERYDAY IT GETS ON THE ROAD IT LOSES VALUE."

What I have learn is everyone experience is different and yet some are the same. What I am writing about is my experience with Uber.I have a love/hate view about Uber. I love the opportunity but hate the fees and the fares. I have had fares run $140 but my payout was around $80. That's steep when the average fare for me is around 7 to 15 bucks for up to 30 mins of driving (not including driving to pick up)  Anyways below is a more in depth review of my experience.1st, Yes you can make money if you have strict discipline of great service, long hours and always accepting trips. 2nd Your “fare total” is not your net payout total. (real life example if you do $140 in fares your take net payout will be $80) This doesn’t include your cost for fuel, maintenance, taxes, and other expenses which you have to figure out yourself. 3rd You are not going to do $90,000 in fares driving a Prius in King George  or Prince William 40 hours a week. 4th Speaking of $90,000 in fares those drivers are driving Sedans and SUV’s that’s Uber luxury services not Uber X. Uber X drivers receive min of $5.35 of which the payout after Uber’s fee around $3.00. A little less for $5.00 cancelations fees (only paid passengers meet certain requirements.)In the DC market The SUV’s pay the best at $25 fare min but only $10 when passengers cancel providing they met certain requirements. I don’t know how much the net payout is because I don’t own a SUV or participate in that service. 5th If you want to see higher net payments,"

It is higher than $0.00, though.Uber is great if your primary goal is to meet people.California minimum wage is $10.00 per hour.If your goal is to make minimum wage or higher, you will fail (in Long Beach, CA).The Uber advertisements of 17.66 per hour (Gross fares.

Until I was offered something more stable, I at least wanted to keep contributing to our household. I have actually enjoyed it quite a bit. I've done almost 70 rides and not had a single one where I felt as though I was in danger, or where my passengers were disrespectful. It's nice to talk to new people and provide a safe service to those who can't, don't, or shouldn't drive for whatever reasons. One thing that does concern me is what I've heard about Uber's attitude towards their drivers. There have been whispers that even when drivers follow the rules of not having a firearm in the vehicle, they can still get in trouble for using other items like mace (not prohibited in Uber's terms of use) against a passenger if the need arises. Although I guess it doesn't surprise me, since Uber drivers are not considered ""employees"" and technically don't have any recourse against their ""employer"", and we are considered disposable.I came into the program at a bad time, where the rate taken out of each fare by Uber is the highest it has ever been (25%) on top of the $1.90 safe fee in my area (also high compared to some other areas). However, I would still say that I make some decent pay when I actually get a good number of calls, since it doesn't seem like there are a lot of other drivers in my immediate area. I strongly recommend, from my own experience, trying out working in the ""drinking"" hours (as I like to call them) which is from about 6 PM to 2 AMish.

They don't have a tipping platform to collect tips.They've recently lowered rates almost 40% and they expected us to be happy with it.  We are a little busier with the lower rates, but now we sit in traffic for 33% less pay.  That's a lot, some times you will get a ride during heavy traffic that is 3 miles, so you sit in traffic for a hour and make $12 in time and $3 in mileage, so $15 in an hour.  Subtract their fees, then subtract wear and tear on your car... not worth it.  Then consider the time you have to go pick someone up.  You time enroute is unpaid.  Uber also requires that you do not begin the trip (start charging) until they get in the car.  You can wait 10 minutes for someone, who will not be tipping you.... so even though you made $15 gross in the example above ($10 net that hour), you may have spent 10 minutes getting there and 10 minutes waiting unpaid... so what's your real hourly rate?Uber will be good when they figure out how to care for their drivers the way their competitor does.

Please tell everyone about the rival company where at least you will make up your commission fees in tips.

When the CEO was asked by Forbes Magazine why he would risk upsetting partner drivers by raising commissions again on them, he said ""Because we can"". Corporate greed at its worst is Uber.

I have enjoyed my time the only things that aren't so great about it are on the driver side. However it is what you agree to signing up for Uber so on the rating scale this is no way to account for that. There aren't any benefits or additional ways to earn cash like bonuses and so forth. No way to advance upward. Job security is dependent on a rating scale. Which in a way leaves it out  of your hand. The few times I have encountered people that were in a authoritative position has been OK. You don't get to interact with your co-workers on a day to day basis and they also are your competition. So, job culture is pretty positive when interacting with customer's and any time you can get through to Uber."

What I noticed on every trip was the rider always had some other place to go besides the destination. I was uncomfortable and decided to quit because my last trip I had a couple making out in the backseat. Uber has a rating system which the rider rates you. It's on a scale from 1-5. 5 is the highest. If you fall below a 4.7 Uber will fire you. So if a rider doesn't like you or your clothes they rate you poor and you are doomed. I didn't feel like there was any job security and that I was disposable. You also have to accept 80% requests or Uber will fire you. You have a general feeling that Uber doesn't care about you. When I asked to resign they could have cared less and terminated me. Those ads you see on TV are false stating you can make $660 a week. You would have to work every day of the week to make that. I feel as a prior driver they are exaggerating incomes.

4329,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",2015-04-18,"Set your own schedule, amusing conversation, good money if you're willing to hustle","No company culture or camaraderie, erratic fare adjustments, hourly guarantees are only occasionally offered to spike business",1,,"Typical day at work: It's pretty straightforward. I pick people up, drive them to a destination, and try to engage in good conversation. Most conversations are amusing, some get personal, but generally it's pretty standard small talk.As far as management and co-workers, I work completely by myself and on my own schedule. There is an operations center, and obviously Uber has a corporate headquarters, but I don't really interact with anyone from Uber (including other drivers).When I talk about the hardest part of the job, I should start by saying that I'm truly optimistic that Uber will eventually get to a stable place where the business can flourish, driver partners can earn well, and customers are happy, but that day is not today, and not likely to be anytime in the foreseeable future. In this market, we're in the precarious position where supply tends to eclipse demand at most hours, and profitability for the individual driver depends heavily on whether the driver is willing (and able) to drive long hours, late into the night and early morning hours. Our operations center is still fighting with the airport in regards to allowing us to transport passengers legally, and while Uber claims they have reached a compromise, the airport calls it a stalemate. Compensation at this juncture could best be described as erratic, but this is to be expected with a new business model. Uber is trying to figure out the best price for passengers and drivers, but lowering prices alienates drivers, while raising prices alienates passengers. Summertime will be a real testament to the Uber"

I also decide how many hours to work. As an Uber driver I meet different people and therefore different personalities. Also, as an Uber driver customer service quality is at must. The hardest part of being an Uber driver is the traffic in peak hours but at the same time is when one make more on the rides. Networking and having nice conversations with my riders that is what I personally I enjoy the most. Especially on peak hours time can fly!"
4334,1.0,los angeles,2015-01-25,none,"no pay when you put it all on paper, car milage, expenses, getting in touch with customer service",436,32,Took someone to the airport from hollywood fare said $27. I get paid a week later and the statement says -$.86 due to uber cuts then on top of that cell phone rental fees.  I bought an iphone recently to avoid the $10 week fee then uber lowers their rate again 20%.  I bought a 2012 prius back when the rate descent.  Long story short dont waste your time working for them unless $5 an hour and your car racking up miles is what you are looking for.    The new hourly guarentee seems like a joke too.    Before the pay was cut by 50% I enjoyed driving.  The people were cool and each day was different.  Its too bad.

I deal with all sorts of customers but my demeanor doesn't change.  My goal is to get customers to their destinations safely and satisfied.  We are graded by them on a scale of one to five stars just as they are.

4338,1.0,Washington DC,2014-09-20,You make your own schedule,Too many cons. Can't write all of them here,715,57,"If you are looking for a job, please look somewhere else. Uber isn't a good company to work with. First of all, Uber doesn't communicate properly with the drivers. Uber drops the prices constantly without even telling the drivers. For instance, when I started, going from Silver Spring to Dulles Airport was $66. Last time I did the same thing and it was only $56. From the $56, Uber takes 20%. Do the math and see how much you have left. The drivers are on the road doing the most difficult part of the job but get nothing at the end.  Uber also takes some fees (Uber rider's fee..etc) from your paycheck. I don't know the purpose of these fees. You pay $100 to get the phone but Uber advertises like they give you the phone for free. NO, you don't get the phone for free. You have to pay $100 for it. In addition to Uber fees, you put gas in your car, pay the insurance and car note. It means to make a little bit of money with Uber you have to drive for very long periods of time. My health is more important than driving drunk people around. Second, Uber's rating system is terrible. As drivers, we can't see what the riders write about us. How will you improve if you don't even know what is written about yourself?Because of the rating system, customers or riders are extremely demanding behaving like they own your life. I remember myself carrying luggage, groceries, strollers...etc of customers and taking the stairs with them but at the end you don't get any good review. Many times I had more than 5 people in my car and playing music very loud because that's what the riders wanted but"

Don't pay you what you earned.",307,27,"When they first came into town things started out great.  You could make money with hard work.  Now they have reduced charges to customers by 15% which means drivers makes less money.    They charge drivers $10 per week to use their services whether they drive or not, so you can accrue these charges.  We already pay $100 to rent the unit when we first start driving.  Cancellation fee: if client cancels after certain period of time drivers were paid $10 and clients charged.  Now fee is $5 and we are never paid.  The excuse is ""Rider was first time user, so we do not charge first time users.""  They can't provide proof.  Did a test with a friend who was a Uber user all the time.  She wasn't charged fee and I wasn't paid.Navigation system that we pay $10 per week only works !/2 time, other 1/2 takes you the wrong direction and clients cancel due to long wait, so not paid.Management and Uber Support never answer questions, just skirt around the issue quoting policy which we can read ourselves.  Never answer the question.Unfortunately, the don't care about the driver with UberX any more, just about how much they can make.Surge stays on for 5 minutes at a time.Don't work for Uber in Nashville. Many of us are quitting and changing companies.All contact to local Home Office and support is handled only by email.  Can't meet face-to-face even about you pay check."

Log onto the Uber app when you can work.CONS:Uber charges $10.00 a week for the phone that they provide you. They state the charge is for data usage.Poor Toll reimbursement – Uber will tell you they reimburse there driver tolls during a rider trip this is not always the case.Diluted driver network – Uber’s driver network is so diluted you can end up waiting hours in your car for a trip request even in hotspots. Poor Dallas Management - College grads that can’t make decisions or tie their shoes. The only way you can get in touch with someone at Uber is via email, good luck getting a valid response. Uber promotes that there is a 10% gratuity included in each trip this is not the case. Drivers do not get a 10% gratuity. Drivers get zero!Trip cancellations - This happens all the time. You get a trip request and drive to the pick-up location then the rider cancels the trip or is a no-show and you get zero. Uber advertises that drivers can make $25 - $35 per hour this is 100% false. After all is accounted for you will probably make $8.00 to $9.00 per hour in the Dallas market.Wear and tear on your car, more car maintenance and oil changes.Drunk rude people – you will have to deal with this all the time… cheers.Uber’s end of the week reports will make it look like you’re a rock star making good money. This is clearly fuzzy math. You will need to take all things into consideration.Uber does not take out taxes, you will be responsible to pay these taxes when you file.Higher Insurance premiums – If you are"

They pay weekly and their platform is very simple to use. The passengers are typically nice and meaningful conversations arise from the experience.
